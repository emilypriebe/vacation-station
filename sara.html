      <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>This is Sara's favorite place to visit. She lived her for a few years with her mom and brother. This tropical island has many places to explore,              which is one of Sara's favorite things to do. </p>

      <h3>Brief Description</h3>
      <p>  Sicily is the largest of the Italian islands, separated from the Continent by the Strait of Messina and surrounded by the Ionian, the Tyrrhenian and the Mediterranean Seas.
        It is one of the pearls of Southern Italy and can be discovered, understood and experienced through a series of itineraries dedicated to areas of interest ranging from nature to history and traditions.
        Nature seems to have endowed all its wonders to this land: mountains, hills and above all the sea, with its incredible colors, its crystal-clear water and the beauty of its seabeds, in no way inferior to those of other seas.</p>
